## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

Our goal is to use Data Science to answer the questions highlighted below and analyze data
schoolchildren using one of the most powerful data manipulation tools in
Python, the Pandas:

1. Is there a difference in school performance between students from public and private schools?
2. What differentiates schools that form high-performing students?
3. Schools (public or private) with higher budgets have students with better Math and Writing test scores?
4. The size of the school (small, medium and large) influences school performance of the student?
5. Which type of school (public or private) has the highest approval rate?

The case study also has a complete data analysis applied to problem solving.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

We will use dummy data for this project, but which could represent real data.

The data was generated from the [Realistic Data Generator](https://www.mockaroo.com).

The data is available in the dataset session along with Jupyter Notebooks.
